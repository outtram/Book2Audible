Kerry Chillemi is a clinical psychologist with a Professional Doctorate in
Clinical Psychology who has experience in the welfare, health, and private
practice sectors. Kerry’s areas of expertise include anxiety, ADHD, autism
spectrum disorder and more. Kerry navigates the world as a
neurodivergent person herself, which informs her neuro-affirming and
neuro-biological approach to therapy with ADHDers. She developed The
Functional Legacy Mindset approach to educate people on how different
minds function (to embrace their strengths) and the legacy of such minds
in terms of the benefits to society. The theory of this approach is grounded
by the therapeutic benefits of embracing the authentic self, to promote a
sense of purpose, in which clients feel empowered to embrace their
unique strengths and abilities to contribute to society in ways that feel
authentic and meaningful to them. Kerry’s personal journey as a mother
of a neurodivergent child includes advocating for a paradigm shift
towards research informed inclusive practices, respectfully encouraging
empowerment and innovation for the good of all.
