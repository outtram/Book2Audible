This book uses the term ADHDer as established and used by the ADHD
community. It also uses identity-first language that puts the disorder first
(e.g., neurodivergent individual), in contrast to ‘person-first’ language
(e.g., adults with ADHD).
Neurodiversity is a term coined by an Australian sociologist named Judy
Singer. The term is a concept that has arisen from brain studies that have
shown that people with learning or thinking differences are wired
differently. A neurodivergent person refers to an individual whose brain
processes information in a way that is not typical of most people.
Neurodivergence is a term that describes different manifestations of
neurodivergent thinking.
This book intentionally does not distinguish between different
presentations of ADHD (e.g. hyperactive-impulsive, predominantly
inattentive, combined), and/or the substantial overlap between Autism
and ADHD.
